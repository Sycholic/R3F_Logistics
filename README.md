This is an attempt to continue to update, fix and maintain the Arma 3 script mod called [R3F] Logistics.

This is not an official release it is an archive of the original with the idea of providing a place for those
who wish to use and implement these scripts into their server or mission.

The original scripts/zip will be kept untouched under the 3.1 tag name.  Any changes after this will fall
under a new version tag name for clear seperation of the original vs anything updated or changed for simplicity.

                             This is allowed under GPL v3
